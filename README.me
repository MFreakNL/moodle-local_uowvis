# The assessment mapping plugin
This plugin shows users and teachers a visual display of course modules indicating when they are due
and how much of the overall course grade they are worth

You can use this to identify student workload, highlight to students their upcoming assessments and
their value (indicating how much time they might want to spend on it). It can also be used by teachers,
to decide where to schedule their own assessments in comparison to other courses that might make up a
related degree, such that you avoid overwhelming a student with work.

## Some caveats to be aware of
- This plugin reveals total grade value and structure of courses to all logged in users, so do not use if you wish to keep info like this private
- A user with the appropriate permission can select any set of courses and display them, irregardless of if they could normally see it in Moodle or not

## Supported versions
This plugin has been tested against moodle 3.7 and 3.8 only currently, with more to come.
